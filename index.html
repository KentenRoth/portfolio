                                <p> Hello,
                                    <a class="text-design">My name is Kent Roth</a>. I am currently an automotive
                                    technician, but I am looking to make
                                    the transition to a developer role.
                                    <a class="text-design">My current skills include HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript, and I am currently learning MongoDB and NodeJS.</a> I have been
                                    thinking about changing careers for a few years, and now I have started to teach
                                    myself how
                                    to code with courses on
                                    <a class="text-design">Udemy.com and Devslopes.com.</a>
                                    I make time each night to do something that will help me advance towards the goal
                                    of becoming a developer. The thing that
                                    keeps me so interested in coding is the constant challenges and the amount of
                                    problem-solving
                                    that goes along with it. I also enjoy how many options of different languages and
                                    frameworks
                                    there are that you can learn. Coding was something that was very interesting to me
                                    in high
                                    school, but at that time
                                    <a class="text-design">my school only provided basic HTML and CSS class that didn't
                                        even last an entire semester.</a>
                                    After high school, I enrolled at Hamilton College to learn computer science but was
                                    soon overwhelmed by how much it costs
                                    to live on my own. Due to financial issues, I had to drop out of college and go
                                    full time
                                    working. I started working as an automotive technician, and I have been with the
                                    same company
                                    for the last 14 years. During those 14 years, I got a lot better with managing my
                                    finances
                                    and enrolled at Kaplan University (now Purdue Global) and
                                    <a class="text-design">earned my Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration.</a>

                                    years ago, and even though I am not very good, I find it very relaxing. I think its

                                    the being outside having fun with friends that lets the stress melt away. When it

                                    has been a new found joy over the last few years. I use to get very tired very

                                    reading, but over the last few years I have been reading a lot more, and I find it
                                    very enjoyable.
                                    I do not have a favorite genre of books. I like to mix it up to give myself a wider
                                    variety
                                    of things.
